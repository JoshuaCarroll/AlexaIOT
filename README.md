----------

Features
-------------

I am trying to make AlexaIOT support the full Alexa Voice Service (AVS) latest API **(v20160207)**

> **Currently Working:** - *This list probably wont be updated often. *

> - Downchannel to receive directives from Alexa
> - Very basic http server to authenticate user
> - Audio player / Audio recorder
> - Badly written code <- My treat!

> **TODO:**

>  - Further API2 improvments
>  - Skills support
>  - Alarms support - STARTED - *25%*
>  - GPIO examples - Waiting for my equipment to arrive

Please contribute!
------------- 
Please help me with this project. It's a starting point at best and far from where I or others would like it to be. A lot of code in this project can be improved for a full Alexa C# Wrapper
